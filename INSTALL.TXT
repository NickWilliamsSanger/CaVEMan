System Requirements
===================

caveman is designed to run in a compute farm/clustre environment.
caveman depends on:
  htslib 1.3 <https://github.com/samtools/htslib/releases/download/1.3/htslib-1.3.tar.bz2>


Compilation
===========

If you have a local install of htslib:

Type 'make' if you have the following environmental variables $HTSLIB set
to be the directory of your local install of each.

Otherwise the command below will hopefully help you.

make HTSLOC="/full/path/to/htslib" TEST_REF="/path/to/GRCh37/genome.fa.fai"

If you wish to temporarily install htslib purely for building caveman:

Type './setup.sh <install_directory>' within the CaVEMan directory. Caveman executables
will be installed to 'install_directory/bin/'.

Installation
============

Copy 'bin/caveman', and other executables in bin/ to a location you want
(e.g. a directory in your $PATH).
