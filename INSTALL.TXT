System Requirements
===================

caveman is designed to run in a compute farm/clustre environment.
caveman depends on:
  samtools-1.0
  htslib
both can be found here <https://github.com/samtools>


Compilation
===========

Type 'make' if you have the following environmental variables $SAMTOOLS $HTSLIB set 
to be the directory of your local install of each.

Otherwise the command below will hopefully help you.

make LFLAGS="-L/<your path to samtools>/samtools-1.0/ -L-/<your path to htslib>/htslib/" OPTINC="-I/<your path to samtools>/samtools-1.0/ -I/<your path to htslib>/htslib/ -I/<your path to htslib>/htslib/htslib"

LFLAGS=-L$SAMTOOLS/lib OPTINC=-I$SAMTOOLS/include/' to compile caveman 
where $SAMTOOLS is the path to your local install of samtools. 
SAMTOOLS)/ -I$(HTSLIB)/ -I$(HTSLIB

Installation
============

Copy 'bin/caveman', and other executables in bin/ to a location you want 
(e.g. a directory in your $PATH). You may also copy 'docs/caveman.1' to a directory in your $MANPATH such
that the `man' command may find the manual.
