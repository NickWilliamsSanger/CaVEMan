System Requirements
===================

caveman is designed to run in a compute farm/clustre environment.
caveman depends on the samtools library <http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/>. 


Compilation
===========

Type `make' to compile caveman. 


Installation
============

Copy 'bin/caveman', and other executables in bin/ to a location you want 
(e.g. a directory in your $PATH). You may also copy 'docs/caveman.1' to a directory in your $MANPATH such
that the `man' command may find the manual.
